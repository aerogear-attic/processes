This documentation covers the AeroGear processes relating to:

* User Feedback
* Code Contributions
* Community 
* Documentation Contributions

It aims to answer questions such as:

* How do decisions get made around here?
* When I engage with the community (bug report, question, pull request, roadmap suggestion), how do I do it without annoying anyone? What should my expectations be?
* If I don't hear back, what's the polite way to raise my question again?
* How do I contribut to AeroGear?
